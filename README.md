This repo is my pathetic attempt to solve the [Euler project](https://projecteuler.net) problems using Python. Since this is more my Python tutor than Math interest, I have often gone overboard with doctests and what not.

## [Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.  
[Solution](./problem1_multiple3and5.py): 2318


## [Problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
Euler Project problem statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:  
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...  
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.  
[Solution](./problem2_even_fibonacci.py): 1089154

## [Problem 3](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?    
[Solution](./problem3_max_prime_factor.py): Could not wait till the answer. Algo works, taking time

## [Problem 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.  
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.  
[Solution](./problem4_palindrome_product.py): 906609 = 993 x 913
